Separate by county, and build a regression line for each county. Take a look at the counties with the steepest and slowest slopes. You might want to factor in county population

Plot a heatmap of which counties have had the most cases using that plotting library

Plot new cases over time by computing the difference in county per time unit

Does county population have an effect on total cases?

Does total cases have an effect on death rate?

overlap cases, deaths, hospitalizations per capita between largest and smallest counties

deaths per hospitalization rate?

HYPOTHESIS to TEST (maybe?):
Some form of linear modeling, maybe expected versus actual predictions or something
can do train and test modeling

Regression of new cases rate compared to death rate


1)
Total cases across all of VA

2)
Cases, hospitalization, death per day across VA

3) 
Cases/deaths across counties by size

4)
cases/deaths per capita across counties by size
