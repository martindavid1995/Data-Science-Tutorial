Separate by county, and build a regression line for each county. Take a look at the counties with the steepest and slowest slopes. You might want to factor in county population

Plot a heatmap of which counties have had the most cases using that plotting library

Plot new cases over time by computing the difference in county per time unit

Strip populations from https://www.virginia-demographics.com/counties_by_population and use them in analysis
